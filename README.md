## My process

### Built with

- SASS
- Javascript
- BEM
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This's my first project that I've used SASS preprocessor and BEM methodoly together, so I could divide each section according to the their purpose and It helped me to write less code which is essential for DRY principle , therefore I used some of utilities without write same functionality again. Meanwhile this project sharpened my grid and flex feature , even though I know all usability sometimes you could forget subtle feature. Beside all of these stuff I get used work with image when they don't fit in terms of responsiveness and screen sizes. Instead of coping with tutorial hell , you would try it out by yourself with this kind of small projects that ease your coding skills no matter how they are difficult.

## Acknowledgments

I gave my best though, I've been coping with last image section before the footer , I could not fit to full of the screen size If you find any solution of this little issue you would send me message whenever you want.

Sincerely.
